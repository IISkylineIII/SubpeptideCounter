# SubpeptideCounter

# Description
SubpeptideCounter is a lightweight Python script that calculates the number of possible subpeptides that can be formed from a cyclic peptide of length n. The calculation is based on the combinatorial formula for counting all contiguous subpeptides in a circular sequence, excluding the full peptide.

# This tool is particularly useful in bioinformatics for:
*Analyzing theoretical peptide diversity
*Simulating mass spectrometry fragment patterns
*Educational purposes in computational biology and proteomics


# Functionality
calculate_subpeptides(n)
Purpose: Computes the total number of distinct contiguous subpeptides that can be formed from a cyclic peptide of length n, excluding the full-length peptide.

# Parameters:
n (int): Length of the input cyclic peptide.

# Returns:
int: Number of subpeptides.

# Example Usage
```
def calculate_subpeptides(n):
    # Calculate the number of subpeptides using the formula
    num_subpeptides = (n * (n - 1)) // 2
    return num_subpeptides

# Sample input
input_length = 31315

# Calculate and print the number of subpeptides
result = calculate_subpeptides(input_length)
print(result)
```
# Output Example:
490933905

# Applications
* This script can be applied in several bioinformatics and proteomics scenarios, including:
* Mass Spectrometry Analysis: Helps simulate all possible theoretical fragments from a cyclic peptide.
* Peptidomics: Supports understanding of combinatorial complexity of short peptides.
* Sequence Diversity Studies: Useful in predicting the number of possible internal sub-sequences in peptide research.
* Education: Illustrates mathematical models in molecular biology.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
